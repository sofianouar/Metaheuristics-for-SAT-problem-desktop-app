# Metaheuristics-for-SAT-problem
Using java, we tried to find the optimal solution for each SAT instance (uf75-325 / uuf75-325) from https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hoos/SATLIB/benchm.html usimg ,etaheuristics.
For this, we first implemented the blind search algorithms (Breadth-First Search , Depth-First Search.) and the heuristic algorithm using two heuristics. 
(Details are explained in report.pdf)
Then, we explored the genetic and the particle swarm algorithm.
