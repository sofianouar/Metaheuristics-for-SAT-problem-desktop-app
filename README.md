# Metaheuristics-for-SAT-problem
Using java, we tried to find the optimal solution for each SAT instance (uf75-325 / uuf75-325) from https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hoos/SATLIB/benchm.html usimg ,etaheuristics.
For this, we first implemented the blind search algorithms (Breadth-First Search , Depth-First Search.) and the heuristic algorithm using two heuristics. 
Then, we explored the genetic and the particle swarm algorithm.
To facilitate the use, we implemented a java interface to interact with.

# How to use the project
To run the project, firstly you need to configure a java runtime environment,
METHOD 1 : download the "jar file version" and run it easily.
METHOD 2 : you can access the "CODE SOURCE VERSION", you see that yu have all the classes and algorithms. To execute it go to src>gui>main.java
